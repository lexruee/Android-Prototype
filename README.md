Mensa-Unibe
===========
Mensa@Unibe is an android prototype application for receiving the daily meals of the canteens at the university of bern.

The app uses a self made JSON/REST web-service (http://mensa.xonix.ch/) to get the available canteens and the daily meals.

##Download the prototype
You can download the prototype [from this repo](https://github.com/lexruee/Mensa-Unibe/blob/master/bin/MensaUnibeApp.apk).
But you can also clone this repo and build the app by yourself.
```
git clone https://github.com/lexruee/Mensa-Unibe
```
